# Simplicity WUI jQuery

A simple framework to create UI on Web browser.

## About the framework's name

It's Simplicity.

## Then, why WUI jQuery?

WUI stands for Web User Interface, and jQuery is the only JavaScript library used here.

This framework will have another variant named Simplicity GUI Flutter for mobile development.

## Design Principles

- Prefer Simplicity in HTML structure.
- Vanilla CSS oriented, then.. a little JS.
- Default behavior should be an explicit option.
